# Project EVA 

This project is mostly gonna be me and a bit of AI trying to create an "unlimited money glitch".
I will try to achieve this with a 1% profit thresold on the stock market, by buying shares which look like they're gonna go up and then sell them as soon as 1% profit has been made. 
The profit margin can, of course, be changed to anyones liking.

My goal is to create an AI which will exactly predict the Stock market and then handle this information accordingly.

Welp, I wanted to do this project in python, but it seems like I've slipped into C#... Whoopsie 

I'm building 2 different implementations, one that works with crypto wallets and the other one? I don't even know . . .

#To-Do
    1. fix the crypto API endpoints
    2. fix the core (oof)
